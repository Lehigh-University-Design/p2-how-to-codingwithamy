            <h3>  Desiderius Erasmus </h3>
            <p> Historians say that the concept journaling or keeping a diary has existed since the Middle Ages. That doesn't come to a surprise as people needed a way to keep track of their throughts. However, the ability to read and write was a skill reserved only for the wealthy, as each book used to be made by hand. During the Renaissance period, it was a popular activity for nobles to keep what were called "commonplace books." These were essentially notebooks that resembles what we know today as "bullet journals." It wasn't until the 17th centuries, when industrialism came in place and the printing press was invented, that reading and writing became more mainstream. 
                Commonplace books were not personal diaries or even a way of recording the owner’s inner thoughts, but rather a way of collecting and organizing a variety of information and material that came to the person from a variety of sources – a gathering of informational "scraps."
                Back then there were how-to guides for commonplace books, written by Renaissance scholars to teach those who wanted to learn the skill. As early as 1512, scholar Desiderius Erasmus penned a guide to commonplace book note taking titled De Copia.

            <h3>The Baldwin family</h3>
            <p> 
                Following the invention of the printing press in the mid 14's, many families starting using bibles to record their family histories (such as their name, date of birth, and dates of death). By the mid 1400s, people would often use the bible as sort of a folder as they stored important newspaper clipings or essentially 'scraps.'
                By the late 1800s some bibles even included open portrait slots where the family could insert and store photographs of family members. These antique bibles were, what could be considered, family scrapbooks.
                The Baldwin family used the pages to store family photographs and it served as their family scrapbook from the 1870s through the 1920s

            <h3>Thomas Edison </h3>
            <p> During the 18th century, more and more people kept diaries and wrote about their daily lives. One notable figure is Thomas Edison. 
                One of his diary entries was about his vacation in the summer of 1885.
                The entries were devoid of scientific topics. Instead, the diary recorded rather more mundane events.              
                In the particular entry shown above, we can read that Edison was fretting about his smoking habit—of how it had deformed his upper lip into a Havana curl, and how he detested the “nicotinny” feeling it gave him.     </p>
                This goes to show that a great inventor like Edison also had ordinary troubles to contend with, just like the rest of us.

            <h3>Samuel Pepys</h3>
            <p> 
                During the 1600s and 1700s, the first albums with images were being compiled. These albums were created from collections of prints, etchings, drawings, and other artwork. 
                Samuel Pepys was a notable elite that combined images with journaling. His diaries would contain collections of images accumulated over all his trips all over Europe.

            <h3>Anne Frank </h3>
            <p>It also became common to record important information about family and relevant clippings or mementoes from their lives. In the Anne Frank's diary, she told her story of how life was during World War 2 when she and her family had to hide from the Gestapo. Her diaries included captivating and horrifying memories. In her books, she would include pictures and writings of her struggles.  </p>

            <h3>Adeline Hankey </h3>
            <p>  
                Most importantly, the development of the industrial printing press in the early 1800s was instrumental to modern-day scrapbooking. When printing presses switched from being hand powered to being mechanically powered, it made the mass production of printed materials possible in a way that had never before been seen. Elaborately printed greeting cards, calling cards, postcards, prayer cards, advertising trading cards, and other materials were now viewed as novelty keepsakes by the recipients. 
                During the 1800s, the emergence and increased accessibility of printed material sparked a new trend. People began filling blank, bound books - previously used for journals or artwork - with clippings, cards and printed memorabilia. Some of these books contained a mix of personal journal entries, hand-drawn sketches, and watercolors, along with various scraps of printed material. These books were literally books of scraps.
                in Adeline Hankey’s scrapbook on her husband Maurice’s diplomatic career, she pasted a postcard from Maurice to their daughter on the same page as a family photograph published in the society periodical The Tatler in 1921.

            <h3>Frida Kahlo </h3>
            <p> Frida Kahlo was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. She was best known for her vibrant and uncompromising self-portraits. Frida’s works of art often had themes of death, human anatomy, and personal identity. Her diaries recorded her dreams and thoughts, and there are also poems found within the pages.
                Frida’s diaries also served as her sketchbooks, which she used for some of her illustrations.

            <h3>Edwin Morgan </h3>
            <p>
                Morgan’s 16 volumes of scrapbooks stand out as a significant and distinctive body of early creative work. He began compiling them as an 11 year old schoolboy in the early 1930s The early volumes began in school exercise books and a favourite source of material was weekly general knowledge magazines covering a wide range of subjects from art, archaeology and astronomy to literature, science and zoology. Morgan continued to compile his scrapbooks into adulthood, transferring to large hard backed ledgers and taking material from a wide range of contemporary newspapers and magazines and also incorporating his own artwork, observations and photography.

            <h3>Amelia Fleurx </h3>
            <p> While scrapbooks continued to evolve since those early days of photographs and family mementoes, so too did the design and scrapbooking industry.
                In the late 1900s and early 2000s, special stores devoted to scrapbooking supplies started to crop up across the Western world, as well as magazines and books dedicated to scrapbooking as a hobby.
                Scrapbooking then took a modern turn of preserving and presenting personal memories through books that would actaully be called 'scrapbooks.' In Flerx's scrapbook, she would often incorporate
                poloraids taken with her friends, travel tickets, doodles, and decorative tape. Scrapbooks during this era tried to follow a aesthetic format and was pressured to look pretty for the eye.

            <h3>Szilvia Rad </h3>
            <p>
                Today’s junk journals started as a form of “rebellion” against the idea that you needed to buy expensive papers and supplies to store memories in a book or create personal artwork.
                Where “free” things like cereal boxes, junk mail envelopes, packaging, flyers, leaflets, paper bags and any other form of “junk” we throw away or recycle each day could be turned into something useful, beautiful and worth saving from landfill.
                Rad's journal truly encompasses the true meaning of junk journaling and creates beautiful work from what some may consider the oridinary. On her Youtube channel, she shares her passion for acrylic painting, junk journals and small tutorials about DIY handicrafts.
